# Backlog

From the architecture review of `93169ed` (2026-09-03), after 0.1.0-alpha.5,
the six rounds that followed it, and the field reports from two apps built on
alpha.6, alpha.7 and alpha.8 outside this repo (F1–F15 on 2026-09-06,
F16–F23 and F25–F31 on 2026-09-07). Every item names the
evidence that produced it, so a task that turns out to be wrong can be argued with rather
than guessed at.

**This file is the open list.** The hundred closed entries — each with its
outcome written on top of the original finding, and the tables, profiles and
evidence it argued from — are in
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md); forty-six moved there
on 2026-09-06, the remaining ten field-report entries followed the same day
before the alpha.7 tag, W2 went whole on 2026-09-07 when ADR 0009's driver
half was built, fourteen more cut alpha.9 on 2026-09-08, the fourteen of
this round — W3, W4–W12 and F32–F35 — went before the alpha.10 tag, and F37
followed it the next day, filed and closed after the tag. The index
at the bottom of this file names every one of them, so an id cited by an open
item, a code comment or a commit message can be resolved without opening the
archive. Nothing was renumbered in any of those moves, and nothing ever is.

What is left here is four entries and a plan: three parked headings — C12,
C13 and C14, each waiting for a view that wants it — and F36, which fell out
of building the last two of the four entries the two alpha.9 field reports and
the bake-off produced, and which is filed rather than built on purpose (the
only host driving its own audio device today is the runner). Everything else
that has been filed has shipped: F16–F23 from the two alpha.7 field reports
closed the day they were filed (2026-09-07), F25–F31 from the alpha.8 ones by
the day after (F27 last, on 2026-09-08), C16–C23 landed whole for alpha.9, and
W3–W12 and F32–F35 for alpha.10. C15's remainder was the last split entry, and
it closed on 2026-09-07.

Ordered by area, not by priority. What to do next is under "After alpha.10".

**Legend** — `!` a defect that ships today · `~` a gap with no workaround ·
`.` cost without correctness risk.

---

## Core capability

Composition-over-traits keeps widgets reachable from Lua and C, and it holds for
buttons, titlebars, tooltips and the latency HUD. It stops holding wherever the
widget needs state the core owns exclusively: pointer capture, the Tab ring,
retained scroll offsets, paint order, the OS window.

**The test used here:** could an app author build it from what the bindings
expose today? If no *because the core keeps the state privately*, it belongs in
the core. If no because the data isn't in the IR, it needs a schema row first.

### `.` C12 — Wrapping a column

C10 shipped rows and says why a column cannot follow in the current pass order.
Doing it means one of: a sixth pass (break columns after `grow_heights`, then
re-run the cross-axis fit and grow for wrapping containers only), or making a
wrapping column's cross size definite by fiat (only `Fixed`/`Grow`/`Percent`
widths wrap, `Fit` warns). The second is cheap and covers the real case — a
column with a definite height in a definite-width parent — but leaves
`width: grow` children inside it sized against the container rather than their
column, which is the half that actually needs the extra pass.

Nobody has asked for it. Wait for a view that wants it, and let that view say
which of the two is enough.

### `.` C13 — `space-between` / `around` / `evenly`, and baseline alignment

Two `Align` variants, and neither needs a new pass.

`Align::SpaceBetween` / `SpaceAround` / `SpaceEvenly` on `main_align` change one
expression in `positions`: today the free space becomes one offset before the
first child, and these spread it between them instead. A grow spacer already
covers `space-between` (`<box width="grow"/>` between two children), which is
why this stayed low priority — but it does not cover `space-around`, and it
costs a node. With wrapping in, they apply per line, which is what CSS does.

`Align::Baseline` on `cross_align` is the one with a real dependency: a line's
baseline is the max ascent of its children, and the core does not carry an
ascent per node — `TextMeasure` returns a `Size`. It needs a third number out
of measurement (text nodes have one; a container's is its first baseline-y
child's, and a box with none falls back to its bottom edge, per CSS). Worth it
for the case it fixes: two text sizes on one row sit on different lines today,
which is visible in any label-plus-value row.

### `.` C14 — Aspect ratio

"Square", or "16:9", without knowing either dimension. `Sizing::Aspect(f32)` on
one axis (the other resolves first, then this multiplies it) is the smaller
change and reads like the rest of `Sizing`; a separate `aspect` clamp applied
beside `min`/`max` is the more CSS-like one and composes with `Grow`. Images
already do half of it — a `Fit` height on an `<image>` preserves the intrinsic
aspect against a final width (`fit_heights`), so the machinery and the pass
ordering are proven; this generalises it to a declared ratio on any node.

## From two alpha.7 field reports (2026-09-07)

Both apps that reported on alpha.6 upgraded to alpha.7 and reported again:
the LCARS pomodoro's upgrade notes (`kuialpha7.md`, five numbered wishes)
and the mind map's rewritten `FINDINGS.md`. Each claim below was checked
against `main` at `980bca4` before it became an entry, and two of the
wishes did not survive the check — they are under "Theirs, not ours" at the
end. The theme of both reports is the same sentence: none of what surprised
them was a type error or a failed access-tree assertion, every one was only
visible in the pixels. **All eight, F16–F23, closed the same day** and are in
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#from-two-alpha7-field-reports-2026-09-07)
whole — F23 as ADR 0013, accepted and built for alpha.8 rather than left
for a view. What stays here is the two wishes that were not ours.

### Theirs, not ours

- **Wish 5 (per-surface font handles).** `init(surface)` runs after
  `setup` and can put the font id in the model; `addSystemFont` is
  idempotent per family. The module global both apps carry is a choice
  the alpha.7 `init` made unnecessary, and the pomodoro's report says as
  much under "Ours to fix".
- **`key()` on `Ctx` only.** By design and closed as F6: a window's keys
  come from the OS.
- **`onLayout` firing on every rect change.** That is what the row says
  it does; a first-frame-only hook has no view asking for it yet.

## From two alpha.8 field reports (2026-09-07)

Both apps upgraded to alpha.8 the day it was tagged and reported again:
the mind map's `FINDINGS.md` (an `alpha.7 → alpha.8` section on top of the
alpha.7 one) and the LCARS pomodoro's `docs/findings.md` — a review of
the release's DX rather than of the app — beside its upgrade notes,
`docs/kui-alpha-8.md`, whose "Wishes for the next alpha" are numbered 1–4.
Each claim below was checked against `main` at `19ead84` (the alpha.8 tag)
before it became an entry, and every command the pomodoro ran was run
again from its own directory. Both reports agree on the release: "the
bare version bump broke nothing", `setTime` throwing is "the single best
thing in the release", and the changelog in the tarball made the reports
"materially cheaper to write". What they found is smaller than last
round's and further from the core: two of the seven entries are the
package's distribution, two are doc sentences, and the two that touch the
core are about state the core keeps by key — an editor's and a
playback's — and when it lets go of it.

Three claims did not survive the check whole, and the entries say so: the
pomodoro's fix for caret ranges (`~` floats exactly as `^` does), the mind
map's "there is no shorter way round" (there is none today, and F25 is
it), and the pomodoro's "a window has no equivalent" of `runOut` (the
primitive is there; the promise is not). One entry, F26, is not in either
report: it fell out of checking F25. **Six of the seven, F25, F26 and
F28–F31, closed the day they were filed** and moved whole to
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#from-two-alpha8-field-reports-2026-09-07)
on 2026-09-08, cutting alpha.9; **F27 followed the same day**, once that
release's publish ran the step it built and the registry answered `latest`.
What stays here is the three claims that were not ours.

### Theirs, not ours

- **Per-surface resource handles** (pomodoro wish 1, carried from its
  wish 5). Same answer as last round: `init(surface)` and `view(_, _,
  surface)` reach the surface; the module globals are the app's, and its
  own notes say "our half of this is below".
- **The mind map's `preview.svg` is gitignored**, so the tool it built to
  catch paint regressions has no baseline. The report says it is the
  app's work, and it is.
- **`withEffects` for the chime.** Both reports declined it, for the
  reason ADR 0013 gives.

## From the editor-and-mux assessment (2026-09-07)

The question asked of `main` at `51ed27b`: is kui ready to be the backbone
of a performant editor that opens large files, and of a terminal
multiplexer? The answer was yes to the editor, provided the app owns the
document and hands kui the visible lines (the `modal_editor` and
`syntax_view` shape), and no to the mux, for reasons that are one cache
policy and a few missing primitives rather than the architecture. Each of
the eight entries below names the measurement that produced it. Two
sources: `cargo bench -p kui-core --bench highlight` as it stands in the
tree, and a scratch program against `kui-core` that is **not** in the repo
— fifty rows of two hundred columns at 13 px mono, 18 px line height,
1920×1080 at scale 2, one frame = build + layout + emit, no GPU. C16's "Do"
adds it as a bench so the numbers stop being a one-off. Apple M3 Pro,
release, 2026-09-07:

| frame | cost |
|---|---|
| `highlight_2x55_warm` — two panes × 55 highlighted code lines, nothing changed | 160 µs |
| `highlight_2x55_typing` — one line retyped per frame | 228 µs |
| `highlight_2x55_scrolling` — one line per frame scrolls in | 282 µs |
| `highlight_2x55_cold` — every run on screen is new (a file opened) | 1.65 ms median; one sample of thirty at 101 ms |
| `highlight_2x55_warm_rich` — each line one `Span` list instead of ~8 nodes | 81 µs |
| 50 × 200 terminal, one text node per line, warm | 0.08 ms, 9.9k quads |
| 50 lines × 10 coloured runs, each under its own `bg` box, warm | 0.18 ms, 10.4k quads |
| 10k cells as one text node each — the strict grid | 1.8 ms, 10k quads |
| 50 new log-like lines every frame (thirty-word vocabulary + numbers) | 21 ms |
| 50 new random-ASCII lines every frame | 63 ms — cosmic-text alone on the same fifty lines: 62.6 ms `Advanced`, 45.8 ms `Basic` |
| resident memory: at start / after ~135 streaming frames / after 1500 more log-like frames / after 600 random | 6 MB / 747 MB / 2.8 GB / 3.6 GB |

What the table says: a screenful of code costs a fraction of a
millisecond warm and under two cold, which is the editor's case; a
terminal pane whose fifty visible lines are *all new every frame* costs
one to four frames of shaping, and that cost is the shaper's, not kui's
(the cosmic-text-only row is the same number). The memory row is kui's
own, and it is C16.

**All eight, C16–C23, were built between 2026-09-07 and 2026-09-08** and
moved whole, with this table, to
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#from-the-editor-and-mux-assessment-2026-09-07)
on 2026-09-08, cutting alpha.9. **W3 followed them on 2026-09-09**, once
the first Windows round below had run it, found it half right and rebuilt
it as a timer; nothing from this assessment is open.

## From the first Windows round (2026-09-08)

kui ran on a Windows machine for the first time. Windows 11 Pro 26200,
rustc 1.96 / MSVC, an RTX 5080 driving a 3840×2160 display at 239 Hz with
the desktop at 150%, and an idle AMD integrated adapter beside it. The
round was: `cargo test --workspace`, then every windowed example opened for
real, then the C examples built and run in every direction. Six defects,
none of which any headless test in the repo could have seen, and two of them
crashes on the first frame.

The round is a script now — [`scripts/smoke-windows.ps1`](../scripts/smoke-windows.ps1),
wired into `smoke-windows` in [`.forgejo/workflows/smoke.yml`](../.forgejo/workflows/smoke.yml)
after the `cargo test` step. It leans on `KUI_SMOKE_FRAMES=n`, new in
`crates/kui/src/lib.rs`: the runner quits once the main window has
presented n frames, which turns every example into a self-terminating check
with an exit code — a wgpu validation panic is a failure with its stderr,
a window that never paints runs out the timeout instead of passing quietly.
14 examples, 120 frames each, about 1.5 s apiece; it was checked against
the bug it was written for by putting W4 back and watching it fail. The C
half is [`examples/c/build.ps1`](../examples/c/build.ps1), a step of its
own in the same job.

This is what P8 said it could not offer ("On Windows there is no equivalent
tool and no plan for one"): it is not the tree-walking audit
`scripts/ax-audit.swift` is on macOS, and it judges that drawing did not
fail rather than what was drawn — but it needs no permission grant and no
human, and it found six things in one afternoon. P8's two follow-ups are
untouched: `windows_nc.rs` and `access_bridge.rs` still have no test.

**All nine, W4–W12, were built between 2026-09-08 and 2026-09-09** and
moved whole to
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#from-the-first-windows-round-2026-09-08)
before the alpha.10 tag, W7 last — the one that wanted a decision rather
than a patch, settled as: a displacement moves a subtree by whole physical
pixels, scrolling included. Nothing from the round is open; what it did
not cover is in "After alpha.10" below.

## From two alpha.9 field reports and a bake-off (2026-09-08)

Both apps upgraded to alpha.9 the day it was tagged and reported again:
the mind map's `FINDINGS.md` (an `alpha.8 → alpha.9` section on top of the
alpha.8 one) and the LCARS pomodoro's `docs/kui-alpha-9.md`, whose "Wishes
for the next alpha" are numbered 1–4. Beside them, a measured comparison
of kui, iced 0.14 and gpui 0.2.2 — one counter and two stress apps per
framework, same machine, same day — whose kui-facing claims are checked
under "From the bake-off" below. Each claim was checked against `main` at
`e6d96ac` (the alpha.9 tag) before it became an entry, and the mind map's
probe commands were re-read against the Node binding's source rather than
re-run.

The two reports agree on the release: "a drop-in with nothing to change"
(mind map), "the bare version bump broke nothing" (pomodoro), and both
found a release the way F27 said they would — `npm view @qxuken/kui
version` answers `0.1.0-alpha.9`, which closes F27 above. What they found
is one gap in the core's key space, two documents that contradict the
release they shipped in, and two audio edges that `finish` made
askable. **The pomodoro's five ranked asks from alpha.8 all landed**, and
its own notes say three were cheap; the one that was not, `finish`,
"arrived better than what was asked for".

One claim bent under the check, in the direction the report did not
expect: the mind map says a first open is the case `setEditText` cannot
reach. It is worse than that — a *second* open cannot either, because
`key_of` resolves through the last frame and a closed editor was in no
recent frame. The app's per-node key cache is what makes its second
opens work, and the fix below has to seed a retained editor as well as a
new one.

**All four, F32–F35, were built on 2026-09-08** and moved whole to
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#from-two-alpha9-field-reports-and-a-bake-off-2026-09-08)
before the alpha.10 tag. What stays here is F36, which fell out of
building the last two of them and is in neither report.

### `.` F36 — A host driving its own audio device can report an end and nothing else

Found reviewing F34 and F35 together, and in neither report. A host that
drains `take_audio_commands` and drives a device itself — which is the
whole point of audio being data — can answer `kui_audio_ended` (C,
`kui-ffi/src/resources.rs:359`) or `audioEnded` (Node,
`kui-node/src/lib.rs:730`) when a playback finishes. There is no
`kui_audio_truncated` / `kui_audio_refused` and no Node equivalent, so the
two new codes are raised only by the Rust runner's own kira backend.

Both codes nonetheless ship to a Node audience: `truncated-playback` and
`playback-refused` are in `docs/props.md`'s warnings table and in
`index.d.ts`'s `WarningCode` union, because both are generated from
`diag.rs` and that is the right thing for one table to do. So a Node reader
is told about two warnings their binding cannot produce, and a C host that
finds a stop landed on a live handle has nowhere to say so.

Not urgent: the only host driving its own device today is the runner, and
the codes are correct for it. It is an asymmetry in a door that already
exists, and the fix is the same shape as the door — two appended C
functions (no ABI bump, as C23) and two `#[napi]` methods, each calling the
`Core` method the runner calls.

**Do:** `kui_audio_truncated(ctx, playback, at)` and
`kui_audio_refused(ctx, playback)` beside `kui_audio_ended`; `audioTruncated`
/ `audioRefused` on Node's shared `core_methods!` macro beside `audioEnded`;
one test each driving the warning through the binding, the way
`crates/kui-ffi/src/tests.rs` drives `kui_audio_ended` today.

### From the bake-off

The comparison's kui numbers are its own and stand as reported: on the
animated grid kui holds 120 fps at 1.3× less CPU than iced and 2.5× less
than gpui, warm text is a wash with iced, cold text buys 41% CPU against
iced's 82% with a resident-set rise to 183 MB that is the 64 MB text
budget plus the atlas behind it (C16), and idle is 100 MB at 0% CPU.
Four kui-facing claims were checked against the tree:

- "kui links an audio engine, a clipboard and AccessKit into the default
  runner whether or not you use them" — two-thirds wrong.
  `crates/kui/Cargo.toml` has `audio` and `accesskit` as default features
  a build turns off; only `arboard` is unconditional. A `clipboard`
  feature is a two-line change, and nobody has asked — under "Rows, when
  a view asks".
- "the middle mouse button routes nowhere" — true and already parked
  (C2, same paragraph).
- "no gradients" — ADR 0005 declined them with the reasoning written
  down; "no z-index" and "one shadow" are the same ADR's paint vocabulary.
- "`Value::as_str` can fail at runtime where iced's `match` cannot" —
  true, and the price of the one contract Lua, C and JSX share; the
  comparison says as much.

Its one recommendation — "publish kui to crates.io, even as an alpha" —
is a decision, not an entry, and it has a fact attached: **the name
`kui` is taken on crates.io** (`XuShaohua`, "WebGL charts", one version,
0.1.0, published 2023-04-04, no repository, 1,629 downloads);
`kui-core`, `kui-ffi`, `kui-lua`, `kui-node` and `kui-wgpu` are free. So
the runner crate would publish under another name, or the name would
have to be asked for from its owner — crates.io does not reassign a name
without one. Under "Distribution" in *After alpha.9*.

### Theirs, not ours

- **Per-surface resource handles** (pomodoro wish 1, fourth report).
  Same answer, delivered where the app reads: a `howto.md` answer under
  F33 rather than a fourth backlog paragraph.
- **The stock `<button>` paints its own look.** The mind map converted
  its toolbar and got "a row of seven primary-blue buttons across a dark
  toolbar", and the report reads the line right: `ButtonProps`' doc says
  a button that needs any other row is a `<box role="button">` with the
  rows spelled out. The deletion line's condition was a button that
  looked like the stock one; theirs never did. Nothing to change.
- **`preview.svg` is gitignored**, third report running. Theirs, and
  their notes say so.
- **`justFinished` depends on the tick's liveness** (pomodoro, "What to
  watch"). A model-side sound lifetime that holds while the clock moves
  is the app's design and its headless assertions guard it.

## From the two alpha.10 upgrade reports (2026-09-09)

Both apps upgraded to alpha.10 the day it was tagged and reported again:
the mind map's `FINDINGS.md` and the LCARS pomodoro's
`docs/kui-alpha-10.md`. F37 came out of the same pair and closed first;
what the rest of the round produced is four entries, **F38–F41, all built
on 2026-09-09** and moved whole to
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#from-the-two-alpha10-upgrade-reports-2026-09-09).

The theme is not last round's. Every one of them is a fact the core or the
driver owns that never reached the view — the width an editor measures
itself at, the settings a window learns as it opens, the setting the user
changes while it is open — and **three of the four were filed by the apps
as their own problem**. The check was done by running the reports' probes
against a build rather than by reading the tree, which is what turned two
paragraphs of workaround into defects: the mind map's "the mechanism is a
property of the design rather than a slip" is F41, and it is a slip.

Three claims did not survive the check, and are below. One of them —
"the self-terminating window is not in the package" — is a facility the
package has and does not document, which is F33's shape again and became a
`howto.md` answer rather than an entry.

### Theirs, not ours

- **`KUI_SMOKE_FRAMES` is not in the npm prebuilds** (mind map). True,
  and deliberate — the changelog's own reasoning — but the conclusion
  drawn from it, that "the one facility for getting a windowed app under
  test is unavailable to every app consuming the package", is not. `setup`
  is handed the window *and the loop*: `await loop.frame()` counts
  presented frames, `win.close()` ends it, and `runWindowed`'s promise
  resolves with the final model, so the process exits with a code. Run
  from this tree: five frames in 302 ms, then `window closed, final model
  = {...}`, exit 0. It is the better shape for an app — it is the app
  asking, in the only place that knows a window is being opened to be
  looked at rather than used — and it was reachable in alpha.7. A `Test
  it` answer in `howto.md` now says so.
- **`truncated-playback` "did not come"** (pomodoro). It comes. A Node
  window, a real device, a 3 s sound and an `<audio>` node removed 0.28 s
  in raises it with the full message; the report's own run is the one
  thing here that cannot be reproduced, and the likeliest reading is that
  its chime had finished (a stop that lands after the sound ended is not a
  truncation, and the core says so). What the report is right about is
  that it had no way to tell, and that is F36 and the pomodoro's wish 1:
  `audioCommands()` is on `Ctx` and not on `KuiWindow`, so a window can
  neither see the queue nor say whether a device is open. Still open,
  still not urgent.
- **A second is drawn 1562 ms long** (pomodoro, "the seconds were not
  equal"). Filed by the app as its own and it is: `tick: { every: 250 }`
  is how far past its boundary a second can be drawn, and `every: 16` is
  what the tick doc asks for. kui's share was said to be the 1062 ms pump
  stall — which is not the driver: 2390 pumps over 20 s idle, worst gap
  41 ms, and that one was the first frame. `pump_app_events` is starved
  for as long as the platform holds the run loop (a live resize or a
  window drag on macOS and Windows), which a pumped loop cannot pre-empt
  and a `setTimeout` cannot outrun. Worth a sentence in the docs if it
  comes up again; not an entry.
- **`setEnv` for a window** (pomodoro wish 2). Refused, as its doc
  comment says: the runner reports the real window every frame, so
  anything pushed would be overwritten before the next view ran. The
  reduced-motion branch is asserted headless, which is where a machine
  the test is not running on can be described. If a view ever needs the
  override in a window, the place for it is the launcher — an app asking
  in its own code, the same line `KUI_SMOKE_FRAMES` draws.
- **`preview.svg` is gitignored**, fourth report running. Theirs, and
  their notes say so.



## After alpha.10

Grouped by kind, not urgency. Nothing here blocks the tag. It was "After
alpha.9" until 2026-09-09, when the first Windows round it described had
landed whole for alpha.10 and the heading moved with the tag; "After
alpha.8" before that, until the editor-and-mux round landed for alpha.9;
"After alpha.7" before that, until ADR 0012's remainder and ADR 0013 landed
for alpha.8; "After alpha.6" before it went to
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#after-alpha6) whole
rather than accumulating strikethroughs, because every line of it had closed.

**Build.** ADR 0004 step 1's leftover: the glyph atlas and shape cache are
still per window because `Core::output` hands out `&mut GlyphAtlas` (see
`kui-session-atlas-constraint`); it waits for a case where two windows share
enough text to matter. C15 is closed (2026-09-07): its remainder was
profiled and the passes that could be skipped are, and what is still above
the 2026-08-31 baseline is the struct's size in the app's own builder chain,
which the archived entry measures and leaves.

**Build next.** Nothing with a written ADR and no code, and nothing filed
that is not either parked or deliberately unbuilt: after alpha.10 the open
list is C12, C13, C14 and F36. The `fragment` element, [`docs/adr/0015-a-fragment-element-and-the-painter-it-is-not.md`](adr/0015-a-fragment-element-and-the-painter-it-is-not.md), was proposed, measured twice, accepted and **built on 2026-09-08** — a box a registered WGSL function paints, in four bindings with a corpus scene, plus `animate` as a plain row and ABI 9. Its two measurement sections are why it was accepted (naga costs a cold build of `kui-core` alone; the draw-call split costs about 0.6 µs of CPU a fragment and nothing the GPU can see) and its amendment is what the building changed — including a collision the design could not have seen, that JSX's own `Fragment` sentinel was the string `'fragment'`. Before it, slots, [`docs/adr/0014-slots-an-extension-fills-in-place.md`](adr/0014-slots-an-extension-fills-in-place.md), were proposed, accepted and **built on 2026-09-07** for alpha.9 — an extension fills a place the host declares in its own view, under a namespace the host decides, with `Value` parameters in and replies out; its status block records what the building changed, and the first test it pins was a defect before it: an extension whose root carried no `key` was rekeyed whenever the host added a child at the root. Before it, ADR 0012's
decisions 2, 3 and 6 — the last such item — **landed on 2026-09-07**, the
day after decision 5 did: a frame's departures are admitted or refused
together, a new removal outranks ghosts already in flight, the
`exit-budget` warning names the frame's removal, and the corpus `exit`
scene pins the change in four bindings with the phase the ADR asked for
(and the correction it needed: `bulk` had to leave in a frame of its own).
The next thing to build was what the next field reports asked for, and
all seven landed the same day they were filed (2026-09-07), each with its
outcome written on top of its entry above: F25 (`setEditText` seeds the
editor the next frame declares, and warns when none does), F26 (a budget
on undeclared editor and scroll state), F27 (every alpha also takes the
`latest` dist-tag — built, and unverified until the tag it writes exists),
F28 (the clause on `quads()` and `access`), F29 (the `audio` element's
`finish`), F30 (`settled` and `frame` on `WindowLoop`) and F31
(`docs/howto.md`, the `**What breaks.**` bullet list from alpha.9 on, and
what a deletion line names). All seven are in the archive as of
2026-09-08; F27 last, once alpha.9's publish ran the `latest` step it
built and the registry answered.

The alpha.9 reports came the same day the tag did, and with a bake-off
against iced and gpui beside them; F32–F35 are what survived the check,
and all four were built on 2026-09-08 in the order this paragraph asked
for — F32 first, then F33's page and guard, then F34 and F35 together as
one `Core::audio_*` door each on the same driver seam. F36 fell out of the
last two and is filed rather than built, for the reason its entry gives.
The alpha.10 reports came the day after that tag, F37 first and then the
four of F38–F41, all built on 2026-09-09 with their outcomes written on top
of their entries in the archive. What is open from that round is nothing:
its three surviving "theirs, not ours" are answered above, one of them by a
`howto.md` answer.

**Editor and mux (2026-09-07, built 2026-09-07/08).** The assessment
section above was the order of work, and it was followed: C16, C18,
C17, C19 for the editor and C21, C23, C22 for the mux all landed with
their outcomes written on top, then C20's element in every binding, the
corpus `ime` scene and C19's wrapped long lines the next day — all eight
are in the archive. W3 was built blind against winit's source; the first
Windows round (2026-09-08) ran it, found it half right, and rebuilt it as
a timer — see the entry. What the round found beside the entries: Lua's
`text()` mutated a shared options table, `npm run gen` described the
previous build, the C parity assert caught a field appended in two
orders, and two things the examples showed once run — the counter's
first click waiting 92 ms for the audio device to open, and a departing
list drawing past its own box — are fixed under alpha.9's `### Fixed`.

**Windows (2026-09-08), and what a second platform is worth.** The platform
ran for the first time and the round is a script: `scripts/smoke-windows.ps1`,
in `smoke-windows` beside the `cargo test` step, with the C round from
`examples/c/build.ps1` beside it. W3–W12 all shipped in alpha.10 and are in
the archive; W7 was the one that wanted a decision rather than a patch, and
it was settled on 2026-09-09 — a displacement moves a subtree by whole
physical pixels, scrolling included.

The lesson is worth more than the entries. Nine of the ten defects the round
found were invisible to every headless test in this repo, and two were
crashes on the first frame; the tenth kind arrived the same week from the
other direction, on **Linux**, where CI caught a C extension that could not
load into a Node host at all (glibc's `dlopen` defaults to `RTLD_LOCAL`, so
the addon offered none of its `kui_*` to a plugin — fixed in `native.cjs`
before the tag, and under alpha.10's `### Fixed`). Both are the same shape:
a loader or a driver behaving differently per platform, under an API whose
tests all pass on the machine the work was done on. Three platforms build
here; only one of them is developed on.

What the round still does not cover is P8's two follow-ups, unchanged:
`windows_nc.rs` has no test that runs anywhere, and neither does
`access_bridge.rs`. The next Windows session's list, in order: run the round
under `Chrome::Custom` (the subclass is uncovered by everything above), and
run it on the integrated adapter to see what a second GPU changes. The Linux
equivalent is smaller and worth naming: the C round (`examples/c/build.sh`)
runs in `check`, and the plugin half of it now has a Node host in the same
job — that is what caught this one.

**Design, wanting an ADR.** A **painter** — the iced-shaped hatch that ADR 0015 (above) names and does not build: a Rust trait or a C extension's function pointers over the shared `Gpu` and the frame's encoder, under the `PainterId` that has been reserved in `resources.rs` since the first commit, placed by a marker quad the renderer splits around as it splits around a fragment. The first thing in a frame that would not be data, so it waits for a view a fragment cannot serve: a 3D viewport, a simulation, a backdrop a copy cannot make. Otherwise nothing new since ADR 0014 was built on 2026-09-07 and amended on 2026-09-08; of what it left open, a slot for Node (W11), extensions in `kui_run` (W9) and an extension offering slots of its own (W12) are built, and what is left — replies from `view`, name-plus-kind — waits for a view. Two instances of one extension are answered: the host namespaces them. Effects an app defines (F23) is
[`docs/adr/0013-effects-as-data.md`](adr/0013-effects-as-data.md),
proposed and then accepted and built on 2026-09-07 — reviewed for alpha.8
rather than left for a view, and its status block says what outweighed
*do nothing*. The exit animations' `animating()` policy is
**done (2026-09-07)**, as
[`docs/adr/0012-the-exit-budget.md`](adr/0012-the-exit-budget.md) —
accepted and built whole, decision 5 first and the rest a day later. It
moved the question rather than answering it: `animating()` is measured free
(a full store owes the driver 12 frames at 0.09% of a budget each) and does
not change, and the boundary is what was wrong — a 1000-row list gets its
first 512 rows sliding out and the rest blinking away. It also found the
two things this entry used to say that the code disagreed with: the
`exit-budget` warning has existed since C8, and `mindmap.tsx` removes
nothing. Still wanting an ADR: rounded hit-testing, which
ADR 0010 declined to settle and Status / next names: `HitRegion.clip` is a
`Rect`, so a hit near a rounded corner is a hit. Two things ADR 0008 left
open and did not think worth a row yet: `aria-atomic`, and asking AccessKit
upstream for a real announcement in `TreeUpdate` — two of the three platforms
have the API behind it, and AccessKit's whole event surface is a tree diff.

**Rows, when a view asks.** A configurable focus-ring colour (README names
it). `required` / `invalid` and heading `level` (ADR 0001 follow-ups).
Per-button `on_click` and middle-button routing (C2 left them "reach the
core and route nowhere"; the bake-off noticed the same). A `clipboard`
feature beside `audio` and `accesskit`, so a build that wants no `arboard`
can say so — the bake-off's idle figure counted it, and nobody has asked. Physical key positions beyond what `60ca137`
carried. One did ask, on 2026-09-07: an i3-style tab bar wanted `grow`
tabs floored at their labels, and `minWidth: "fit"` / `minHeight: "fit"`
landed the same day for alpha.9 (the CHANGELOG entry says why it is not
the default — a fit width is the unwrapped one).

**Distribution.** The bake-off's one recommendation is to publish to
crates.io, "even as an alpha", because "distribution is the one [risk]
that time makes worse". A decision, not an entry, and it has a fact
attached (checked 2026-09-08): the name `kui` is held there by another
crate ("WebGL charts", one 0.1.0 from 2023-04-04, no repository), while
`kui-core`, `kui-ffi`, `kui-lua`, `kui-node` and `kui-wgpu` are free.
Publishing means asking the owner for the name or shipping the runner
under another — crates.io does not reassign a name without its owner —
and the npm side has no such problem. Nothing in the tree blocks it: the
`publish = ["forgejo"]` lines are the only registry-specific thing.

**Parked on their own terms.** C12 (column wrapping), C13 (`space-between`
and baseline), C14 (aspect ratio), C5(b) (core-side virtualisation), rounded
clip nesting. Each says "wait for a view that wants it", and each should keep
saying it until one does.

**Hygiene.** Archiving is done five times over: the forty-six of
2026-09-06, the ten field-report entries that followed them before the tag —
so all of F1–F15 sit together — W2 whole on 2026-09-07, once its driver
half was built, the fourteen of alpha.9's round on 2026-09-08, and the
fourteen of this one (W3, W4–W12, F32–F35) before the alpha.10 tag. This
file is now three parked entries, F36, and this section — the shortest it
has been since it was written.
Still open, both waiting on something outside the repo: enable `SMOKE_MACOS`
/ `SMOKE_WINDOWS` the day a runner exists (P8) — which has two jobs waiting
for it now, F13's launch probe beside the AX audit, sharing the one
Accessibility permission — and remove Lua `env.focus` at 0.2 (P3, R7).

**For the by-hand round**, which is R4's list in the archive and now also
`### Native verification` under each release heading in the CHANGELOG. Two
items are in it because the frame they live in is between a press and a
release, which no headless assertion reads:

- `npm run mindmap` in `examples/node`, then **drag the empty canvas and
  watch it while the button is down** — the map has to follow the cursor,
  cards and connectors together, not jump into place on release. That is
  ~~F15~~, checked for alpha.7 with `screencapture` inside a synthetic drag
  (`kui-macos-window-quirks` has the recipe); by hand, a slow drag is enough.
- **Windows: grab the title bar while something animates** (`toasts`,
  mid-spring) and watch whether it keeps moving — W3, filed 2026-09-07
  from a report and not reproduced here.
- The same gesture into a popup: press in the owner, drag into the popup,
  release on an item. ADR 0009's consequences name four `CGEvent` checks and
  W2's archived entry records what each one showed when the driver half was
  built (2026-09-07). Windows adds a fifth nothing has run — mixed DPI across
  two monitors, which is what the arithmetic is in physical pixels for.

## Closed — index

A hundred entries, all in
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md) and all verbatim.
This index is here so an id resolves without opening that file: the open items
above cite A1, C7, C9, C10, D2, P3, P5, P8, R3, R6 and S2, "After alpha.10" and
the hygiene note cite C2, C5(b), P3, R4 and R7, and code comments, ADRs and
commit messages cite ids of their own. All hundred are whole in the
archive. **C11**, **W2** and **C15** were each split for a while — an entry
appearing there in full and here trimmed to what was still open — until their
remainders landed: C11's last step on 2026-09-06, ADR 0009's driver half on
2026-09-07, and C15's profile the same day. Each move took the whole entry to
the archive, and none renumbered it.

The archive also holds four sections that are records rather than work: the
suggested sequence as it stood on 2026-09-05, "After alpha.6" as it stood on
2026-09-06, and the three release sections —
[Release 0.1.0-alpha.6](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#release-010-alpha6-2026-09-05),
whose R1–R7 are the half-baked items finished before that tag, and
[Release 0.1.0-alpha.7](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#release-010-alpha7-2026-09-06),
which is what the pre-tag round ran and what it could not answer, and
[Release 0.1.0-alpha.8](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#release-010-alpha8-2026-09-07),
the round that watched ADR 0012 at its boundary, and
[Release 0.1.0-alpha.9](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#release-010-alpha9-2026-09-08),
the editor-and-mux round.
