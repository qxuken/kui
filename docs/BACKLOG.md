# Backlog

From the architecture review of `93169ed` (2026-09-03), after 0.1.0-alpha.5,
the six rounds that followed it, and two field reports from apps built on
alpha.6 outside this repo (F1–F15, 2026-09-06). Every item names the
evidence that produced it, so a task that turns out to be wrong can be argued with rather
than guessed at.

**This file is the open list.** The sixty-three closed entries — each with its
outcome written on top of the original finding, and the tables, profiles and
evidence it argued from — are in
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md); forty-six moved there
on 2026-09-06, the remaining ten field-report entries followed the same day
before the alpha.7 tag, and W2 went whole on 2026-09-07 when ADR 0009's driver
half was built. The index at the bottom of this file names every one of them,
so an id cited by an open item, a code comment or a commit message can be
resolved without opening the archive. Nothing was renumbered in any of those
moves, and nothing ever is. What is left here is three parked headings — C12,
C13 and C14 — and what comes next; F16–F23 from the two alpha.7 field
reports all closed the day they were filed (2026-09-07). C15's remainder was
the last split entry, and it closed on 2026-09-07.

Ordered by area, not by priority. What to do next is under "After alpha.7".

**Legend** — `!` a defect that ships today · `~` a gap with no workaround ·
`.` cost without correctness risk.

## Core capability

Composition-over-traits keeps widgets reachable from Lua and C, and it holds for
buttons, titlebars, tooltips and the latency HUD. It stops holding wherever the
widget needs state the core owns exclusively: pointer capture, the Tab ring,
retained scroll offsets, paint order, the OS window.

**The test used here:** could an app author build it from what the bindings
expose today? If no *because the core keeps the state privately*, it belongs in
the core. If no because the data isn't in the IR, it needs a schema row first.

### `.` C12 — Wrapping a column

C10 shipped rows and says why a column cannot follow in the current pass order.
Doing it means one of: a sixth pass (break columns after `grow_heights`, then
re-run the cross-axis fit and grow for wrapping containers only), or making a
wrapping column's cross size definite by fiat (only `Fixed`/`Grow`/`Percent`
widths wrap, `Fit` warns). The second is cheap and covers the real case — a
column with a definite height in a definite-width parent — but leaves
`width: grow` children inside it sized against the container rather than their
column, which is the half that actually needs the extra pass.

Nobody has asked for it. Wait for a view that wants it, and let that view say
which of the two is enough.

### `.` C13 — `space-between` / `around` / `evenly`, and baseline alignment

Two `Align` variants, and neither needs a new pass.

`Align::SpaceBetween` / `SpaceAround` / `SpaceEvenly` on `main_align` change one
expression in `positions`: today the free space becomes one offset before the
first child, and these spread it between them instead. A grow spacer already
covers `space-between` (`<box width="grow"/>` between two children), which is
why this stayed low priority — but it does not cover `space-around`, and it
costs a node. With wrapping in, they apply per line, which is what CSS does.

`Align::Baseline` on `cross_align` is the one with a real dependency: a line's
baseline is the max ascent of its children, and the core does not carry an
ascent per node — `TextMeasure` returns a `Size`. It needs a third number out
of measurement (text nodes have one; a container's is its first baseline-y
child's, and a box with none falls back to its bottom edge, per CSS). Worth it
for the case it fixes: two text sizes on one row sit on different lines today,
which is visible in any label-plus-value row.

### `.` C14 — Aspect ratio

"Square", or "16:9", without knowing either dimension. `Sizing::Aspect(f32)` on
one axis (the other resolves first, then this multiplies it) is the smaller
change and reads like the rest of `Sizing`; a separate `aspect` clamp applied
beside `min`/`max` is the more CSS-like one and composes with `Grow`. Images
already do half of it — a `Fit` height on an `<image>` preserves the intrinsic
aspect against a final width (`fit_heights`), so the machinery and the pass
ordering are proven; this generalises it to a declared ratio on any node.

## From two alpha.7 field reports (2026-09-07)

Both apps that reported on alpha.6 upgraded to alpha.7 and reported again:
the LCARS pomodoro's upgrade notes (`kuialpha7.md`, five numbered wishes)
and the mind map's rewritten `FINDINGS.md`. Each claim below was checked
against `main` at `980bca4` before it became an entry, and two of the
wishes did not survive the check — they are under "Theirs, not ours" at the
end. The theme of both reports is the same sentence: none of what surprised
them was a type error or a failed access-tree assertion, every one was only
visible in the pixels. **All eight, F16–F23, closed the same day** and are in
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#from-two-alpha7-field-reports-2026-09-07)
whole — F23 as ADR 0013, accepted and built for alpha.8 rather than left
for a view. What stays here is the two wishes that were not ours.

### Theirs, not ours

- **Wish 5 (per-surface font handles).** `init(surface)` runs after
  `setup` and can put the font id in the model; `addSystemFont` is
  idempotent per family. The module global both apps carry is a choice
  the alpha.7 `init` made unnecessary, and the pomodoro's report says as
  much under "Ours to fix".
- **`key()` on `Ctx` only.** By design and closed as F6: a window's keys
  come from the OS.
- **`onLayout` firing on every rect change.** That is what the row says
  it does; a first-frame-only hook has no view asking for it yet.

## After alpha.7

Grouped by kind, not urgency. Nothing here blocks the tag. It replaces
"After alpha.6", which went to
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#after-alpha6) whole
rather than accumulating strikethroughs: every line of it had closed.

**Build.** ADR 0004 step 1's leftover: the glyph atlas and shape cache are
still per window because `Core::output` hands out `&mut GlyphAtlas` (see
`kui-session-atlas-constraint`); it waits for a case where two windows share
enough text to matter. C15 is closed (2026-09-07): its remainder was
profiled and the passes that could be skipped are, and what is still above
the 2026-08-31 baseline is the struct's size in the app's own builder chain,
which the archived entry measures and leaves.

**Build next.** Nothing with a written ADR and no code. ADR 0012's
decisions 2, 3 and 6 — the last such item — **landed on 2026-09-07**, the
day after decision 5 did: a frame's departures are admitted or refused
together, a new removal outranks ghosts already in flight, the
`exit-budget` warning names the frame's removal, and the corpus `exit`
scene pins the change in four bindings with the phase the ADR asked for
(and the correction it needed: `bulk` had to leave in a frame of its own).
The next thing to build is whatever the next field report asks for.

**Design, wanting an ADR.** Nothing. Effects an app defines (F23) is
[`docs/adr/0013-effects-as-data.md`](adr/0013-effects-as-data.md),
proposed and then accepted and built on 2026-09-07 — reviewed for alpha.8
rather than left for a view, and its status block says what outweighed
*do nothing*. The exit animations' `animating()` policy is
**done (2026-09-07)**, as
[`docs/adr/0012-the-exit-budget.md`](adr/0012-the-exit-budget.md) —
accepted and built whole, decision 5 first and the rest a day later. It
moved the question rather than answering it: `animating()` is measured free
(a full store owes the driver 12 frames at 0.09% of a budget each) and does
not change, and the boundary is what was wrong — a 1000-row list gets its
first 512 rows sliding out and the rest blinking away. It also found the
two things this entry used to say that the code disagreed with: the
`exit-budget` warning has existed since C8, and `mindmap.tsx` removes
nothing. Still wanting an ADR: rounded hit-testing, which
ADR 0010 declined to settle and Status / next names: `HitRegion.clip` is a
`Rect`, so a hit near a rounded corner is a hit. Two things ADR 0008 left
open and did not think worth a row yet: `aria-atomic`, and asking AccessKit
upstream for a real announcement in `TreeUpdate` — two of the three platforms
have the API behind it, and AccessKit's whole event surface is a tree diff.

**Rows, when a view asks.** A configurable focus-ring colour (README names
it). `required` / `invalid` and heading `level` (ADR 0001 follow-ups).
Per-button `on_click` and middle-button routing (C2 left them "reach the
core and route nowhere"). Physical key positions beyond what `60ca137`
carried.

**Parked on their own terms.** C12 (column wrapping), C13 (`space-between`
and baseline), C14 (aspect ratio), C5(b) (core-side virtualisation), rounded
clip nesting. Each says "wait for a view that wants it", and each should keep
saying it until one does.

**Hygiene.** Archiving is done three times over: the forty-six of
2026-09-06, the ten field-report entries that followed them before the tag —
so all of F1–F15 sit together — and W2 whole on 2026-09-07, once its driver
half was built. This file is three open headings and this section.
Still open, both waiting on something outside the repo: enable `SMOKE_MACOS`
/ `SMOKE_WINDOWS` the day a runner exists (P8) — which has two jobs waiting
for it now, F13's launch probe beside the AX audit, sharing the one
Accessibility permission — and remove Lua `env.focus` at 0.2 (P3, R7).

**For the by-hand round**, which is R4's list in the archive and now also
`### Native verification` under each release heading in the CHANGELOG. Two
items are in it because the frame they live in is between a press and a
release, which no headless assertion reads:

- `npm run mindmap` in `examples/node`, then **drag the empty canvas and
  watch it while the button is down** — the map has to follow the cursor,
  cards and connectors together, not jump into place on release. That is
  ~~F15~~, checked for alpha.7 with `screencapture` inside a synthetic drag
  (`kui-macos-window-quirks` has the recipe); by hand, a slow drag is enough.
- The same gesture into a popup: press in the owner, drag into the popup,
  release on an item. ADR 0009's consequences name four `CGEvent` checks and
  W2's archived entry records what each one showed when the driver half was
  built (2026-09-07). Windows adds a fifth nothing has run — mixed DPI across
  two monitors, which is what the arithmetic is in physical pixels for.

## Closed — index

Seventy-one entries, all in
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md) and all verbatim.
This index is here so an id resolves without opening that file: the open items
above cite A1, C7, C9, C10, D2, P3, P5, P8, R3, R6 and S2, "After alpha.7" and
the hygiene note cite C2, C5(b), P3, R4 and R7, and code comments, ADRs and
commit messages cite ids of their own. All sixty-three are whole in the
archive. **C11**, **W2** and **C15** were each split for a while — an entry
appearing there in full and here trimmed to what was still open — until their
remainders landed: C11's last step on 2026-09-06, ADR 0009's driver half on
2026-09-07, and C15's profile the same day. Each move took the whole entry to
the archive, and none renumbered it.

The archive also holds four sections that are records rather than work: the
suggested sequence as it stood on 2026-09-05, "After alpha.6" as it stood on
2026-09-06, and the two release sections —
[Release 0.1.0-alpha.6](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#release-010-alpha6-2026-09-05),
whose R1–R7 are the half-baked items finished before that tag, and
[Release 0.1.0-alpha.7](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#release-010-alpha7-2026-09-06),
which is what the pre-tag round ran and what it could not answer.
