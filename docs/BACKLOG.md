# Backlog

From the architecture review of `93169ed` (2026-09-03), after 0.1.0-alpha.5,
the six rounds that followed it, and two field reports from apps built on
alpha.6 outside this repo (F1–F15, 2026-09-06). Every item names the
evidence that produced it, so a task that turns out to be wrong can be argued with rather
than guessed at.

**This file is the open list.** The sixty-three closed entries — each with its
outcome written on top of the original finding, and the tables, profiles and
evidence it argued from — are in
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md); forty-six moved there
on 2026-09-06 and the remaining ten field-report entries followed the same
day, before the alpha.7 tag. The index at the bottom of this file names
every one of them, so an id cited by an open item, a code comment or a commit
message can be resolved without opening the archive. Nothing was renumbered in
either move, and nothing ever is. What is left here is five headings — C12,
C13, C14 and the remainders of C15 and W2 — plus what comes next.

Ordered by area, not by priority. What to do next is under "After alpha.7".

**Legend** — `!` a defect that ships today · `~` a gap with no workaround ·
`.` cost without correctness risk.

## Core capability

Composition-over-traits keeps widgets reachable from Lua and C, and it holds for
buttons, titlebars, tooltips and the latency HUD. It stops holding wherever the
widget needs state the core owns exclusively: pointer capture, the Tab ring,
retained scroll offsets, paint order, the OS window.

**The test used here:** could an app author build it from what the bindings
expose today? If no *because the core keeps the state privately*, it belongs in
the core. If no because the data isn't in the IR, it needs a schema row first.

### `.` C12 — Wrapping a column

C10 shipped rows and says why a column cannot follow in the current pass order.
Doing it means one of: a sixth pass (break columns after `grow_heights`, then
re-run the cross-axis fit and grow for wrapping containers only), or making a
wrapping column's cross size definite by fiat (only `Fixed`/`Grow`/`Percent`
widths wrap, `Fit` warns). The second is cheap and covers the real case — a
column with a definite height in a definite-width parent — but leaves
`width: grow` children inside it sized against the container rather than their
column, which is the half that actually needs the extra pass.

Nobody has asked for it. Wait for a view that wants it, and let that view say
which of the two is enough.

### `.` C13 — `space-between` / `around` / `evenly`, and baseline alignment

Two `Align` variants, and neither needs a new pass.

`Align::SpaceBetween` / `SpaceAround` / `SpaceEvenly` on `main_align` change one
expression in `positions`: today the free space becomes one offset before the
first child, and these spread it between them instead. A grow spacer already
covers `space-between` (`<box width="grow"/>` between two children), which is
why this stayed low priority — but it does not cover `space-around`, and it
costs a node. With wrapping in, they apply per line, which is what CSS does.

`Align::Baseline` on `cross_align` is the one with a real dependency: a line's
baseline is the max ascent of its children, and the core does not carry an
ascent per node — `TextMeasure` returns a `Size`. It needs a third number out
of measurement (text nodes have one; a container's is its first baseline-y
child's, and a box with none falls back to its bottom edge, per CSS). Worth it
for the case it fixes: two text sizes on one row sit on different lines today,
which is visible in any label-plus-value row.

### `.` C14 — Aspect ratio

"Square", or "16:9", without knowing either dimension. `Sizing::Aspect(f32)` on
one axis (the other resolves first, then this multiplies it) is the smaller
change and reads like the rest of `Sizing`; a separate `aspect` clamp applied
beside `min`/`max` is the more CSS-like one and composes with `Grow`. Images
already do half of it — a `Fit` height on an `<image>` preserves the intrinsic
aspect against a final width (`fit_heights`), so the machinery and the pass
ordering are proven; this generalises it to a declared ratio on any node.

### `~` C15 — `NodeSpec` was 728 bytes and the frame got ~2.5× more expensive — **fixed (2026-09-05), ~two-thirds recovered**

Fixed for the tag by boxing the four cold field groups, which took `NodeSpec`
from 728 bytes to 224 and made alpha.6 16–22% faster than the release before
it. The measurement record — the bisect staircase, the `sample` profiles, the
padding experiment, the recovery table and the two guards now in place — is in
[the archived entry](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#-c15--nodespec-was-728-bytes-and-the-frame-got-25-more-expensive--fixed-2026-09-05-two-thirds-recovered).
What that entry ends on is what is still open, and it is reproduced here as
written:

**What is left.** `frame_10k_rects` is still ~1.5× its 2026-08-31 cost, and
that half is the per-node logic the features added, not the struct. It wants
its own profile now that the cache behaviour has changed — the shape of the
answer is which of the added passes can be skipped wholesale with a tree-level
flag, the way `any_exit` already skips the depart diff. **The threshold half
is done (2026-09-06)**, as `scripts/bench-check.sh`; the profile is what is
left.

The guard, and why it is not the CI check this entry first asked for. The
size test catches the specific mistake that caused this regression; it does
not catch a slow pass, and this one was a staircase of tens-of-microsecond
steps across ~190 commits, no step of which was large enough to fail a
review. R6 found it only by re-measuring the README table for the release.
So the threshold was worth having — but **not in CI**, decided 2026-09-06:
the docker runner is too weak to measure a frame, it would false-fail, and a
check that false-fails gets turned off, which is worse than not having it.
The guard is instead a local `scripts/bench-check.sh` on the pre-tag run
list. It scripts what was already done by hand twice — C15's own bisect and
the alpha.5-vs-alpha.6 table below — checking the previous `v*` tag out into
a worktree under `target/bench-base/`, benching both sides back to back on
the one machine, and comparing medians. Four rows are guarded and fail it at
more than 10% slower (`frame_10k_rects`, `frame_1k_typical`,
`frame_10k_rects_with_text_and_hits`, `deep_nesting_64_levels`); 10% is
twice the ~5% noise floor these measurements have shown. Every other row is
reported and not judged, and a row only one side has is listed rather than
compared.

Two things it does beyond the threshold, both because of how this entry
went. It prints the README's table with HEAD's medians filled in, so
refreshing those numbers at tag time is the same command as the guard rather
than the separate manual pass R6 did. And it watches for the trap the
alpha.5-vs-alpha.6 measurement hit: the bench *builder* can change between
refs (`f6eec64` unified the grid), and then a row is not comparable even
though its name is. When `crates/kui-core/benches/frame.rs` differs it says
which rows still build from source that reads the same at both refs and
which are touched, transitively, and by which item. For a plain grid row
every `Grid` switch is off, so a builder change that only adds a switch
leaves those four comparable; a new switch the row turns on does not.

The same reasoning that kept it out of CI is inside it: a loaded machine
cannot measure a frame either, and this repo's own worktrees are usually
compiling in one. So each side runs twice and the second is read, and a row
whose own two runs disagree by more than the tolerance is marked
**unreadable** rather than given either verdict — it cannot resolve a
difference smaller than its own jitter. The run is **INCONCLUSIVE** (exit 2)
when no readable row failed but some row was unreadable. Both halves of that
were worth having, and both were proven on 2026-09-06 against a busy
machine: `frame_10k_rects` read 119% slower there and the gate refused it,
which is the false-fail the whole design is against; and judging per row
rather than per run is what stops the cheapest bench from vetoing the
others, since `deep_nesting_64_levels` is ~80 µs, where one preemption is
20%, and a global veto threw away three good verdicts to buy nothing. It
also warns before starting, off the summed CPU of what is running rather
than the load average: a one-minute decaying average both cries wolf on a
box that has just gone quiet and misses a lull long enough to bench in.

A note for whoever picks that up: `Quad` also grew, 92 → 124 bytes, and the
display list is one per quad. It did not show up in either profile — emission
is a small share of a frame — but it is the same mistake in the same place,
and `frame_10k_rects_with_shadows_and_opacity` (20k quads) is the bench that
would show it.

## After alpha.7

Grouped by kind, not urgency. Nothing here blocks the tag. It replaces
"After alpha.6", which went to
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#after-alpha6) whole
rather than accumulating strikethroughs: every line of it had closed.

**Build.** ADR 0004 step 1's leftover: the glyph atlas and shape cache are
still per window because `Core::output` hands out `&mut GlyphAtlas` (see
`kui-session-atlas-constraint`); it waits for a case where two windows share
enough text to matter. C15's remainder is unchanged and is the one open
performance item: `frame_10k_rects` is still ~1.5× its 2026-08-31 cost after
the boxing fix, and that half is the per-node logic rather than the struct.
It wants a profile, and the shape of the answer is which added pass can be
skipped wholesale with a tree-level flag, the way `any_exit` already skips
the depart diff.

**Build next.** W2's driver half, below — the one item with a written ADR
and no code. It is the only thing on this file that a user can hit today
(press-drag-release into a popup does nothing), and every part of it is in
`crates/kui/src/lib.rs`.

**Design, wanting an ADR.** The exit animations' `animating()` policy,
revisited against a real view that removes many nodes (ADR 0005 left it
opt-in + a 512-node budget with no duration cap). Rounded hit-testing, which
ADR 0010 declined to settle and Status / next names: `HitRegion.clip` is a
`Rect`, so a hit near a rounded corner is a hit. Two things ADR 0008 left
open and did not think worth a row yet: `aria-atomic`, and asking AccessKit
upstream for a real announcement in `TreeUpdate` — two of the three platforms
have the API behind it, and AccessKit's whole event surface is a tree diff.

**Rows, when a view asks.** A configurable focus-ring colour (README names
it). `required` / `invalid` and heading `level` (ADR 0001 follow-ups).
Per-button `on_click` and middle-button routing (C2 left them "reach the
core and route nowhere"). Physical key positions beyond what `60ca137`
carried.

**Parked on their own terms.** C12 (column wrapping), C13 (`space-between`
and baseline), C14 (aspect ratio), C5(b) (core-side virtualisation), rounded
clip nesting. Each says "wait for a view that wants it", and each should keep
saying it until one does.

**Hygiene.** Archiving is done twice over: the forty-six of 2026-09-06 and
the ten field-report entries that followed them before this tag, so all of
F1–F15 sit together and this file is five open headings and this section.
Still open, both waiting on something outside the repo: enable `SMOKE_MACOS`
/ `SMOKE_WINDOWS` the day a runner exists (P8) — which has two jobs waiting
for it now, F13's launch probe beside the AX audit, sharing the one
Accessibility permission — and remove Lua `env.focus` at 0.2 (P3, R7).

**For the by-hand round**, which is R4's list in the archive and now also
`### Native verification` under each release heading in the CHANGELOG. Two
items are in it because the frame they live in is between a press and a
release, which no headless assertion reads:

- `npm run mindmap` in `examples/node`, then **drag the empty canvas and
  watch it while the button is down** — the map has to follow the cursor,
  cards and connectors together, not jump into place on release. That is
  ~~F15~~, checked for alpha.7 with `screencapture` inside a synthetic drag
  (`kui-macos-window-quirks` has the recipe); by hand, a slow drag is enough.
- The same gesture into a popup, once W2's driver half exists: press in the
  owner, drag into the popup, release on an item. ADR 0009's consequences
  name the four `CGEvent` checks. There is nothing to run until it is built.

## From building C11 step 4 (2026-09-06)

Two findings, neither about the popup itself. Both are decided and in the
archive; this is what W2 left to build.

### `~` W2 — Press-drag-release does not reach a popup, and only the driver can make it — **accepted, unbuilt (2026-09-06)**

The whole entry, with its measurement and the outcome on top, is in
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#-w2--press-drag-release-does-not-reach-a-popup-and-only-the-driver-can-make-it--accepted-unbuilt-2026-09-06).
`docs/adr/0009-press-drag-release-into-a-popup.md` settled the four
questions it raised; what shipped with it is the arithmetic only
(`crates/kui/src/retarget.rs`, decision 7, with its tests). **Still to
build**, all in `crates/kui/src/lib.rs` and none of it headlessly testable:

- `Shell` arms a non-activating popup that opens while the owner's primary
  button is down (decision 1), retargets the owner's `CursorMoved`s into it
  (decision 2), classifies the release with `retarget::landing` — synthesise
  the press-and-release, keep the menu, or dismiss (decision 4) — and
  disarms in `close_pane`.
- The press that dismisses a non-activating popup is consumed rather than
  dispatched (decision 5). This is the one visible change for existing
  apps, and the release that carries it says so under "what you can delete".
- `examples/rust/popup.rs` opens on `on_drag`'s `start` with
  `cursor: "pointer"`, handlers set rather than toggle (decision 6), and the
  four `CGEvent` checks the ADR's consequences list are run on macOS.

## Closed — index

Sixty-three entries, all in
[`backlog/closed-2026-09.md`](backlog/closed-2026-09.md) and all verbatim.
This index is here so an id resolves without opening that file: the open items
above cite A1, C7, C9, C10, D2, P3, P5, P8, R3, R6 and S2, "After alpha.7" and
the hygiene note cite C2, C5(b), P3, R4 and R7, and code comments, ADRs and
commit messages cite ids of their own. Sixty-one of these are simply closed;
**C15** and **W2** appear in both files, whole there and trimmed to what is
still open here. **C11** was a third, until its last step landed on 2026-09-06
and took the whole entry to the archive.

The archive also holds four sections that are records rather than work: the
suggested sequence as it stood on 2026-09-05, "After alpha.6" as it stood on
2026-09-06, and the two release sections —
[Release 0.1.0-alpha.6](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#release-010-alpha6-2026-09-05),
whose R1–R7 are the half-baked items finished before that tag, and
[Release 0.1.0-alpha.7](backlog/closed-2026-09.md#release-010-alpha7-2026-09-06),
which is what the pre-tag round ran and what it could not answer.
